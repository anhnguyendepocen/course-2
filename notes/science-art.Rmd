# Objectives

* Define Tufte's theory of data graphics, data-ink ratio, and chartjunk
* Present and compare examples of minimalistic graphics to their original form
* Assess visualizations under the engineer/designers philosophy

```{r packages, cache = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
library(stringr)

options(digits = 3)
set.seed(1234)
```

# Tufte's world

* Core purpose of visualization is to communicate quantitative information
    * Art is secondary
    * "Above all else show the data"
* Goal is to maximize the data-ink ratio

    $$\text{Data-ink ratio} = \frac{\text{data-ink}}{\text{total ink used to print the graphic}}$$

* **Data-ink** - non-erasable core of a graphic
    * This is what Tufte says we should most care about
    * Minimize all extraneous fluff
* What should we consider to be part of the "data-ink"?
    * Is this literally just the data? Don't we need gridlines or axes? What else can be considered integral to the graph?
* He never offers proof of his hypothesis that less is better

### What is integral?

```{r integral}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) +
  geom_point()
p
```

* Data points
* Axis ticks
* Axis tick labels
* Axis labels
* Background
* Grid lines

What happens if we strip away everything except the data?

```{r integral-void}
p + theme_void()
```

Hmm, so what do we actually need to keep? What should we consider "integral"? What if we remove the background color?

```{r integral-background}
p + theme_bw()
```

* Remove panel box

```{r integral-panelbox}
p + theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
          panel.border = element_blank())
```

* Remove minor grid lines

```{r integral-minor}
p + theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
          panel.border = element_blank(),
          strip.background = element_blank(),
          plot.background = element_blank(),
          axis.line = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

* Remove all grid lines

```{r integral-major}
p + theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
          panel.border = element_blank(),
          strip.background = element_blank(),
          plot.background = element_blank(),
          axis.line = element_blank(),
          panel.grid = element_blank())
```

* Remove tick marks

```{r integral-tick}
p + theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
          panel.border = element_blank(),
          strip.background = element_blank(),
          plot.background = element_blank(),
          axis.line = element_blank(),
          panel.grid = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

* Use serif font

```{r integral-serif}
p + theme_bw(base_family = "serif") +
    theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
          panel.border = element_blank(),
          strip.background = element_blank(),
          plot.background = element_blank(),
          axis.line = element_blank(),
          panel.grid = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

What have we lost? Is this easier to interpret? Harder?

## Chart junk

* Vibrating moire effects
    * Hard to produce in `ggplot2` - no support for them
    * Eye junk
    * Makes the graph harder to decode/interpret
* The grid
    * Minimize/reduce the thickness of grid lines to ease interpretation
    * Less visual clutter to weed through
    * Add some compare/contrast with `ggplot`
* The duck

* Tufte concludes that forgoing chartjunk enables functionality and insight (as Cairo would describe it). Do you agree?

# Compare Tufte minimal graphs to traditional graphs using `ggplot2`

* [`ggthemes`](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes)
* Compare other themes for the same basic plot^[Source for examples: [Tufte in R](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/)]

The goal of Tufte's minimalism is to maximize the data-ink ratio, so we want to modify traditional or default graphs in R and `ggplot2` to minimize use of extraneous ink.

## Minimal line plot

```{r line}
x <- 1967:1977
y <- c(0.5, 1.8, 4.6, 5.3, 5.3, 5.7, 5.4, 5, 5.5, 6, 5)
d <- data_frame(x, y)

ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 6, 1), label = sprintf("$%s", seq(300, 400, 20))) +
  labs(title = "Per capita budget expandures",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Per capita budget expandures\nin constant dollars")
```

* We use `geom_point()` to draw the data points and `geom_line()` to connect the points
* What is the extraneous ink on this graph?
    * Background
    * Title of graph and y-axis labels - redundant
    * x-axis label - year is obvious/self-explanatory
* Missing context - how is this expansion meaningful over time?

```{r minline}
ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_tufte(base_size = 15) +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(5, 6), lty = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 6, 1), label = sprintf("$%s", seq(300, 400, 20))) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = x, label = x) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    x = c(1977, 1977.2),
    y = c(1.5, 5.5),
    adj = 1,
    family = "serif",
    label = c("Per capita\nbudget expandures\nin constant dollars", "5%")
  )
```

* Remove axis and graph titles
* Adds text annotation within graph
* Highlights a 5% increase in per capital expandures
* Changes font to be more aesthetically pleasing, not so blockish

## Minimal boxplot

```{r boxplot}
ggplot(quakes, aes(factor(mag), stations)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Fiji earthquakes",
       x = "Richter Magnitude",
       y = "Number of stations reporting earthquakes")
```

* Key features of a boxplot
    * Lines to indicate:
        * Maximum of IQR
        * 3rd quartile
        * Median
        * 1st quartile
        * Minimum of IQR
    * Dots for outliers
* How many different line strokes do we use?
    * 8 for each graph
    * $8 \times 22 = 176$
* This is extraneous ink

```{r minboxplot}
ggplot(quakes, aes(factor(mag), stations)) +
  theme_tufte() +
  geom_tufteboxplot(outlier.colour = "transparent") +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    x = 8,
    y = 120,
    adj = 1,
    family = "serif",
    label = c(
      "Number of stations \nreporting Richter Magnitude\nof Fiji earthquakes (n=1000)"
    )
  )
```

* Now we use only 22 verticals to show the same data. It could easily be drawn by hand with a single vertical for each category on the x-axis
* Doesn't show outlier info, but is this really necessary?
* Also removes the background color and gridlines

```{r offset-boxplot}
ggplot(quakes, aes(factor(mag), stations)) +
  theme_tufte() +
  geom_tufteboxplot(median.type = "line") +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    x = 8,
    y = 120,
    adj = 1,
    family = "serif",
    label = c(
      "Number of stations \nreporting Richter Magnitude\nof Fiji earthquakes (n=1000)"
    )
  )
```

* Here we use offsetting lines to indicate the middle half of the data rather than using a gap
* Is this prettier? Easier to interpret?

## Minimal barchart

```{r bar}
library(psych)
library(reshape2)

d <- melt(colMeans(msq[, c(2, 7, 34, 36, 42, 43, 46, 55, 68)], na.rm = T) *
            10)
d$trait <- rownames(d)

p <- ggplot(d, aes(x = trait, y = value)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 5, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Watson et al., 1998",
       subtitle = "N = 3896",
       x = "Negative emotion traits",
       y = "Average score")
p
```

* Again, the background is the main culprit - though `ggplot2` offers other default backgrounds

```{r default-themes, dependson="bar"}
p + theme_bw()
p + theme_dark()
p + theme_classic()
p + theme_minimal()
p + theme_void()
```

```{r minbar}
ggplot(d, aes(x = trait, y = value)) +
  theme_tufte(base_size = 14, ticks = F) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.25, fill = "gray", stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 5, 1)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(1, 5, 1),
             col = "white",
             lwd = 1) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    x = 3.5,
    y = 5,
    adj = 1,
    family = "serif",
    label = c(
      "Average scores\non negative emotion traits
from 3896 participants\n(Watson et al., 1988)"
    )
  )
```

* Erases the box/grid background
* Removes vertical axis
* Use a **white grid** to show coordinate lines through the absence of ink, rather than adding ink
    * Allows us to remove tick marks as well

## Range-frame scatterplot

```{r scatterplot}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Car weight (lb/1000)") +
  ylab("Miles per gallon of fuel")
```

* A standard bivariate scatterplot

```{r range-frame}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_rangeframe() +
  theme_tufte() +
  xlab("Car weight (lb/1000)") +
  ylab("Miles per gallon of fuel") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -0.5),
        axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 1.5))
```

* Use the frame/axis lines of the graph to communicate important information
    * Extends only to minimum/maximum values in the data, rather than arbitrary points
    * Explicitly identifies the minimum and maximum values

### With a quartile plot

```{r range-frame-quartile}
library(devtools)
source_url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bearloga/Quartile-frame-Scatterplot/master/qfplot.R')

qfplot(
  x = mtcars$wt,
  y = mtcars$mpg,
  xlab = "Car weight (lb/1000)",
  ylab = "Miles per gallon of fuel"
)
```

* Combine with info on the quartiles of the data to show case this info as well
* Thicker bar indicates inner two quartiles
* Median is explicitly labeled

# Reconsidering Tufte

## When is redundancy better?

![Double-time bar chart of crime in the city of San Francisco, 2009-10. Source: [Visualizing Time with the Double-Time Bar Chart](http://dougmccune.com/blog/2011/04/26/visualizing-time-with-the-double-time-bar-chart/)](http://dougmccune.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/burglary1.png)
    
* Each set of 24 bars show the same data. The top bars run from midnight to 11pm. The bottom bars run from noon to 11am.
* Highlighted regions represent 6-5 (6am-5pm; 6pm-5am)
* Colors represent (roughly) day and night (yellow for day, blue for night)
* Enables representing trends over a 24 hour period without breaking arbitrarily at midnight

* The second graph is incredibly redundant, but which is easier to interpret?
    * Does it pass Tufte's test?
    * What does it mean to be "integral"?

## Does minimalism really help here?

* Accompanying an article declaring that student progress on NAEP tests has come to a virtual standstill

![Chart from Harvard magazine. Source: [Involuntary head-shaking is probably not an intended consequence of data visualization](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2016/11/involuntary-head-shaking-is-probably-not-an-intended-consequence-of-data-visualization.html)](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef01b7c8b60cd9970b-pi)

* What is the comparison we should make?
* Is this too much color?
* Meets Tufte's minimalist standards, probably has a decent data-ink ratio
* Note Grade 4 math scores for whites in 2009-2015 - does this mean no progress or unknown scores?

![Redesigned chart from Harvard magazine. Source: [Involuntary head-shaking is probably not an intended consequence of data visualization](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2016/11/involuntary-head-shaking-is-probably-not-an-intended-consequence-of-data-visualization.html)](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341e992c53ef01b8d23fe1c7970c-pi)

* This version is much clearer - specifically tells us how to compare the scores
* Removes color as a channel, using linetype instead
    * In this situation, is that better or worse?
* Title for the graph makes clear the point tryingg to be made

## Experimental tests of Tufte's claims

* How do we know Tufte's claims are true? We can test them with experiments!

![Source: Figure 2 from [Bateman, Scott, et al. "Useful junk?: the effects of visual embellishment on comprehension and memorability of charts." *Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*. ACM, 2010.](http://www.cedma-europe.org/newsletter%20articles/misc/The%20Effects%20of%20Visual%20Embellishment%20on%20Comprehension%20and%20Memorability%20of%20Charts.pdf)](images/tufte_experiment.png)

### Protocol

* Compared chartjunk versions of graphs to standard/minimalist versions of graphs
* Tested individuals on chart description and recall
* 20 subjects split into short and long-term recall groups
    * Quite a small sample of convenience (university population)
* Collected measures
    * Response scores - did the individual correctly read/interpret the chart?
    * Preferences - which type of chart did the individual prefer? Standard or embellished?
    * Gaze data - where did the subject look during the experiment? At data regions or embellishment regions?

### Results

![Source: Figures 4-6 from [Bateman, Scott, et al. "Useful junk?: the effects of visual embellishment on comprehension and memorability of charts." *Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*. ACM, 2010.](http://www.cedma-europe.org/newsletter%20articles/misc/The%20Effects%20of%20Visual%20Embellishment%20on%20Comprehension%20and%20Memorability%20of%20Charts.pdf)](images/tufte_experiment_results.png)

* No difference for description
* No difference for immediate recall
* Embellished images slightly better for long-term recall (12-22 days after treatment)

### Discussing the results

* Why did the chartjunk not lead to worse description and recall?
    * Chartjunk was related to the topic of the chart
    * "Gets to the point quicker"
* Why would the embellished images produce better long-term recall?
    * Very vivid image
    * Value message - individual believes author is trying to communicate a set of values
    * Embellished images produced more value messages
* Should visualizations be "objective"?
    * Tufte seems to think so: minimalism leads to the data speaking for itself - do we buy this?

## Rethinking Tufte's definition of visual excellence

* Too many of Tufte's claims are based on nothing - no evidence to support his minimalistic approach to graphical design
* Think of the hockey stick chart vs. xkcd on Earth's temperature
    * According to Tufte, both probably have a lot of chartjunk (xkcd more so)
    * But if asked to remember the importance and story of the graph weeks later, which one do you think the average reader would recall better?
    
## Testing this theory

* Design an experiment to test the impact/effectiveness of chartjunk vs. minimalism
* What protocols/features could we use? How could we deploy the experiment?
    * If deployed on a platform such as Amazon MTurk, what are the benefits and drawbacks?
