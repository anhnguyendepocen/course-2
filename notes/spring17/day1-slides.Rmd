* What data is related in the visualization? What are the dimensions/variables?
* Approximately how many data points are recorded in the visualization?
* What makes this a good/bad visualization?
* What story is it conveying?

## Basic data structures

* Data type
* Dataset type

## Data types

## Tables

* Flat table
    * Each row is an item
    * Each column is an attribute
    * Each cell is a value fully specified by the combination of row and column
* Multidimensional table

## Networks

## Trees

## Geometry

* Shape of items with explicit spatial positions
* 0D
* 1D
* 2D
* 3D
* Maps

## Attribute types

## Semantics

* Type vs. semantic
* Key vs. value
